### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was one of my favorites from the beginning of the semester because of how it showed me that these problems could be solved easily. Before I had looked at the instructions I took a moment to think of how I would solve the problem from scratch, and every idea I had seemed too complex. When I opened the assignment it showed me how much I had been overthinking it, and it showed me that these problems were manageable. 

* Lab 6

   I really enjoyed working on Lab 6 because of how we were able to create a simple functioning game that gave us a small look into how video games are created. I enjoy working on easy games because of how it shows even the simplest of games online require a good amount of work. Also, figuring out the logic for the if conditions helped me gain some problem solving experience that came in handy for future labs.

* Lab 12

   Lab 12 was my favorite because of how we were introduced to the Magick Library. The Magick Library showed us how we are able to create images through code using the functions it had built inside such as the colors. To be more specific, one of my favorite parts was creating the random generators because of how I learned specifically how they are created since computers cannot be random. After seeing how to create a simple one, it gave me an idea of how bigger softwares creates theirs. This program also helped reestablish how there are different variable types depending on which libraries are imported which was a nice way to receive some practice.
